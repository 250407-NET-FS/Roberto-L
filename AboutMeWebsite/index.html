        <h3>The Game Store Tracker</h3>
    </a>
    <p>The Game Store Tracker is aimed at helping those starting a business in which they sell games and consoles. This
        would
        allow the owner, authenticated user, to make a store entity in which he can start to add Workers and assign
        positions.
        We will also be able to manage the store's inventory, so that when a worker process a sale, it should record the
        checkout and update the inventory. This project required the use of many .NET technologies, including Entity
        Framework,
        unit testing with xUnit, and much more.
